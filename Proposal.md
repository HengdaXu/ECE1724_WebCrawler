## Motivation

In today, the explosive growth of information has made effective data collection and analysis crucial. As a core tool for data collection, web crawlers are widely used in various fields such as data mining, competitive product analysis, and news aggregation. Drawing from my background in big data analytics, I recognize that effective data collection is not only the first step in obtaining information but also the foundation for in-depth analysis. 

Rust is one of the latest and most popular programming languages, known for its high performance and powerful concurrency, which can significantly enhance the efficiency of web crawlers and accelerate data processing. Additionally, the Rust ecosystem offers several robust web crawler frameworks, such as ‘reqwest’, ‘scraper’, and ‘select’.
